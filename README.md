# Research

This is a respository for the research @ FSU 2025

Dolphot photometry:

- Used old PSF from original pipeline (Savino)
- Obtained big catalog with all dithers using F150W as reference image
  - file name: wlm_f150.phot

Next step:

- Try to do photometry separately with different dithers in each frame, with F150W as reference image
- Try to do the same with individual integration, still with F150W as reference image
